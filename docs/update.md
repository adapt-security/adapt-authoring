# Updating

Getting the latest version of the Adapt authoring tool is as simple as running the installer utility in a terminal with the following command:

```
npx adapt-security/adapt-authoring-installer update --prerelease [DIRECTORY]
```
> If you don't pass the `[DIRECTORY]` param, the updater will use the current working directory.

Once you run this command, the updater will automatically open in your default web browser, and guide you through the rest of the process.
