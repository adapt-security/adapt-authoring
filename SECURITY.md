# Security Policy

The Adapt project takes the security of our software very seriously.

As such, we gladly accept security reports fromour  community, and will investigate and action any fixes in a timely fashion appropriate to the severity of the issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a new security vulnerability in our code, you can repoort it using GitHub's security advisory feature by clicking [this link](https://github.com/adapt-security/adapt-authoring/security/advisories/new). 

There, you will be given more instructions on what information is required when reporting a new security vulnerability.

**For obvious reasons, please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
